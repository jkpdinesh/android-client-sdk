If Licensee breaches any term of this Agreement and does not cure such breach within ten (10) business days of notice of such breach, or if such breach is by its nature incapable of cure, then BlueJeans may terminate this Agreement immediately.  Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice pursuant to Section 11.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, (a) BlueJeans will terminate Licensee’s access to the BlueJeans Code, the Developer Portal, and the BlueJeans Service, (b) Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the BlueJeans Code, the Developer Portal, and the BlueJeans Service, (c) Licensee shall uninstall and destroy all copies of the BlueJeans Code, and (d) Licensee shall return or destroy all Confidential Information (defined below) of BlueJeans. 

8.	Confidentiality

    8.3	Licensee acknowledges and agrees that there can be no adequate remedy at law for any material breach of this Section 8, which breach will result in irreparable harm to BlueJeans, and therefore, upon any such breach or any threat thereof, BlueJeans is entitled to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Licensee (and, if applicable, Licensee’s officers or employees) without the requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to whatever remedies BlueJeans might have at law.
    8.4	From time to time, Licensee may provide BlueJeans with suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information relating to the BlueJeans Code or the BlueJeans Service (“Feedback”).

9.	Indemnification
    9.1	BlueJeans will defend any third party claim or action brought against Licensee to the extent based on the allegation that the BlueJeans Code infringes any intellectual property right (patents, utility models, design rights, copyrights and trademarks or any other intellectual property right) having effect in the United States and BlueJeans will pay any settlements that BlueJeans agrees to in a writing signed by an authorized officer of BlueJeans or final judgments awarded to the third party claimant by a court of competent jurisdiction.

    9.3	Licensee will defend any third party claim or action brought against BlueJeans to the extent based on (a) the allegation that the Custom Integration infringes any intellectual property right (patents, utility models, design rights, copyrights and trademarks or any other intellectual property right) (other than as directly caused by the BlueJeans Code or materials directly provided by BlueJeans hereunder, without modification), (b) a claim relating to the Custom Integration, or (c) Licensee’s breach of its representations and warranties herein. Licensee will pay any settlements that Licensee agrees to in a writing signed by an authorized officer of Licensee or final judgments awarded to the third-party claimant by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    9.4	Each party’s obligations in this section are conditioned on the indemnified party (a) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim, (b) granting the indemnifying party the sole control of the defense or settlement of the claim and (c) providing reasonable information and assistance to the indemnifying party in the defense or settlement of the claim at the indemnifying party’s expense.
    9.5	THIS SECTION 9 STATES BLUEJEANS’ ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY AND SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO BLUEJEANS’ INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

10.	Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR (I) LICENSEE’S BREACH OF SECTION 2.2, SECTION 3, SECTION 5, SECTION 6, OR SECTION 8 OR (II) EITHER PARTY’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 9, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY CAUSE RELATED TO OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN AN ACTION BASED ON A CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, HOWEVER ARISING, FOR (A) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, (B) DAMAGES BASED ON LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR BREACHES IN SYSTEM SECURITY OR (C) ANY DAMAGES THAT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTHWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.

11.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of California. Any legal claim, suit, action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereunder or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule and shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in Santa Clara County, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding and waives any objection based on improper venue or forum non conveniens.

12.	Notice. Notices to be given or submitted by either party to other pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and directed to the address in the preamble to this Agreement or otherwise provided to the other party in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt) or (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested) or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

13.	Miscellaneous.  The parties acknowledge that they are acting as independent contractors who are solely responsible for their own actions or inactions and that no joint venture, franchise, partnership, agency, or other relationship shall be created or implied by this Agreement. Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without BlueJeans’ prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Licensee (regardless of whether Licensee is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement for which BlueJeans’ prior written consent is required. No delegation or other transfer will relieve Licensee of any of its obligations or performance under this Agreement. Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this provision is void. BlueJeans may freely assign or otherwise transfer all or any of its rights, or delegate or otherwise transfer all or any of its obligations or performance, under this Agreement without consent. If any court of competent jurisdiction adjudges any provision of this Agreement to be to be illegal, unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable, but shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agrement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and suepersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. Any terms and conditions of any purchase order or other instrument issued by Licensee shall be of no force or effect. Except as stated herein, this Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing by non-preprinted agreements clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment and signed by each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement effective as of the Effective Date.
